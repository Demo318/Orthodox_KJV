CHAPTER <sup>12</sup>
And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, <sup>2</sup>'Speak unto the children of Israel,
and thou shalt say unto them, “Whatsoever woman have conceived seed, and have
borne a man­child shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of separation for
her monthly courses shall she be unclean. <sup>3</sup>And in the eighth day she shall circumcise
the flesh of his foreskin. <sup>4</sup>And she shall continue in the blood of her uncleanness three
and thirty days; she shall touch no holy thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the
days of her purification be fulfilled. <sup>5</sup>But if she have borne a maid child, then she shall
be unclean twice seven days, according to the time of her monthly courses, and she
shall remain in the blood of her uncleanness threescore and six days. <sup>6</sup>And when the
days of her purification are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb
of the first year without blemish for a whole burnt­offering, and a young pigeon, or a
turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of witness, unto the priest.
<sup>7</sup>And he shall present it before the LORD, and the priest shall make an atonement for
her, and he shall cleanse her from the fountain of her blood. This is the law for her that
beareth a male or a female. <sup>8</sup>And if she be not able to find what is enough for a lamb,
then she shall take two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, one for a whole burnt­
offering, and one for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and
she shall be clean.” ' <sup>10</sup>
