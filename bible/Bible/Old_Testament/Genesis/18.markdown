<sup>1</sup>Now God appeared unto him by the oak of Mamre as he sat at his tent door in the mid of day. <sup>2</sup>And he lifted up his eyes, and looked, and lo, three men stood over him; and he saw them, and ran to meet them from his tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground, <sup>3</sup>and said, 'O LORD, if it be that I have found favour in Thy sight, pass not by Thy servant. <sup>4</sup>Let water now be fetched, and let them wash your feet, and rest Ye under the tree. <sup>5</sup>And I will fetch bread, and Ye shall eat, and after that Ye shall depart on your journey, inasmuch as Ye are turned aside unto Your servant.' And they said, 'So do, as thou hast said'. <sup>6</sup>And Abraham hastened to the tent unto Sarah and said unto her, 'Haste thee, and knead three measures of fine flour, and make cakes baked in ashes.' <sup>7</sup>And Abraham ran unto the kine, and fetched a young calf tender and good, and gave it unto his servant, and he hasted to dress it. <sup>8</sup>And he took butter, and milk, and the young calf which he had dressed, and set them before them; and they did eat, and he stood by them under the tree.

<sup>9</sup>And He said unto him, 'Where is Sarah thy wife?' And he answered and said, 'Behold, in the tent'. <sup>10</sup>And He said, 'I will return, and come unto thee according to this time to the hour; and Sarah thy wife shall have a son'. And Sarah heard at the tent door, being behind him. <sup>11</sup>Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well stricken in years, and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. <sup>12</sup>And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, 'It is not yet come to pass with me until now, and my lord is old'. <sup>13</sup>And the LORD said unto Abraham, 'Wherefore did Sarah laugh within herself, saying, “Shall I then of a surety bear? but I am waxed old”. <sup>14</sup>Shall anything be impossible with God? At this time to the hour will I return unto thee, and Sarah shall have a son.'  <sup>15</sup>But Sarah denied, saying, 'I laughed not', for she was afraid. And he said unto her, 'Nay, but thou didst laugh'. 

<sup>16</sup>And the  men rose  up from  thence, and  looked down  toward Sodom  and Gomorrah. And Abraham went with them, escorting them on the way. <sup>17</sup>And the LORD said, 'Shall I hide from Abraham My servant the thing which I am about to do? <sup>18</sup>But Abraham shall become a great and populous nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him. <sup>19</sup>For I know that he will order his sons and his household after  him,  and  they  shall  keep  the  ways  of  the  LORD,  to  do  righteousness  and judgment, that the LORD may bring upon Abraham all things that he hath spoken to him.' <sup>20</sup>And the LORD said, 'The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is multiplied toward Me, and their sins are very great. <sup>21</sup>I will go down then, and see whether they do according to the cry against them, which is come unto Me, and if not, that I may know.' <sup>22</sup>And the men turned away from thence, and came unto Sodom; but Abraham stood yet before the LORD. <sup>23</sup>And Abraham drew near, and said, 'Wilt Thou destroy the righteous with the ungodly, and shall the righteous be as the ungodly? <sup>24</sup>If there be fifty righteous in the city, wilt Thou destroy them? Wilt Thou not spare the whole place for the sake of the fifty righteous, if they be therein? <sup>25</sup>By no means shalt Thou do this thing, to slay the righteous with the ungodly, and the righteous shall be as the ungodly. By no means! Shalt not Thou that judgest all the earth do right?'  <sup>26</sup>And the LORD said, 'If there be in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the city and all the place for their sakes'. <sup>27</sup>And Abraham answered and said, 'Now have I begun to speak unto my LORD, and I am but earth and ashes. <sup>28</sup>But if the fifty righteous should be diminished to forty and five, wilt Thou destroy all the city for the five?' And He said, 'If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it'. <sup>29</sup>And he spake yet again unto Him and said, 'But if there shall be forty found there?' And He said, 'I will not destroy it for the forty's sake'. <sup>30</sup>And he said, 'Will there be aught against me, LORD, if I speak; but if there shall be thirty found there?' And He said, 'I will not destroy it for the thirty's sake'. <sup>31</sup>And he said, 'Since I am able to speak unto the LORD, what if there shall be twenty found there?' And He said, 'I will not destroy it, if I find there twenty'. <sup>32</sup>And he said, 'Will there be aught against me, LORD, if I speak yet once? But if ten shall be found there?' And He said, 'I will not destroy it for the ten's sake'. <sup>33</sup>And the LORD went His way, when He had left communing with Abraham, and Abraham returned unto his place.
